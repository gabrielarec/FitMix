# FitMix Application

## Description

Workout app with music

This application was designed in order to enable an end user to create a workout and associated playlist that would help motivate them at the gym. The application makes use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and several APIs. Our team utilized the semantic UI library and Jquery libraries to design our application. Through this, we learned about various portions of branching and how to link multiple JavaScript files into one. Additionally, we learned how to better utilize 3rd party APIs.

## Features

Our application uses several primary features:

1. Spotify API to pull in recommended music based on user selection results
2. Workout API to pull in recommended exercises based on user selection results
3. Semantic UI Library to create visuals of the workout and playlist pages
4. The ability to store pages and switch between them

## How to Contribute

Areas where the application's functionality can be built out are: use of Semantic UI and implementation of pause and play buttons from the Spotify Music Player API. To reference this material, please feel free to see the GitHub repository above and create a pull request with your code
